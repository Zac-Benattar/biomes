# Biomes
Simple demo game for a graphics coursework. Didn't score well due to not knowing the submission had to be run as a python package despite the coursework being based around three.js

## Installing and Running the System
- Clone the repo into a local folder.
- Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) and npm (should be installed with nodejs), you may need to restart your terminal to use
npm.
- From the `rt-trainer-app` directory run the following commands in a terminal:
	- Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
	- Run the webserver: `npx vite`
